## Introduction

The cheap availability of high-resolution satellite imagery has already become a powerful tool in economics, just as it has in other research fields and in the private sector.

## Spatial and EO data for Economic analysis

[Conventionally, utilization of spatial or earth observation data for economic analysis was limited to a few economic fields :]{.fragment}

## Spatial and EO data for Economic analysis

[Owing to the recent development of computer vision algorithms, economists have used satellite data not just to explore novel questions but also to tackle questions that could not be answered with traditional data sources. Some of the recent applications include:]{.fragment}

::: incremental
-   GDP Measurement
-   Agricultural production
-   Economic activity
-   Urban development
-   Others

## Tools and Techniques

#### Economists widely employed these two techniques to developed comprehensive analysis:
